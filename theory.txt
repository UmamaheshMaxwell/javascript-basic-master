Javascript
------------
Javascript is a programming language that allows us to 
implement complex features on web pages.

HTML       - is the markup language that we use to structure and give meaning to our web content
CSS        - is a language of style rules that e used to apply styling to our HTML content
Javascript - is a scripting language that enables us to dynamically updating the web content

Syntax Parser
---------------
A program that reads our code and determines what exactly it does and if its grammar is valid

Lexical environment
-------------------
Where something sits physically in the code we write

Execution context
------------------
A wrapper to help manage the code that is running.

Name/ Value Pair
-----------------
A name which maps to a unique values

user : "uma"

Object
--------
A collection of name value pairs

Execution context (global)
-------------------------
global Object
this ( variable)

this - window ( the browser window)
Global Object - window

Global - which is not inside the function 
local - means inside the function 

// Global 
var a ="hello world"

function b(){
    // Local
}

Hoisting
---------
When you declare variables and function s in javascript, 
the engine sets up memory space for variables and functions

if it is a varable it will keep that variable in memoery and 
assign a value called undefined

If it is a function then it will copy entire function and keeps
it in memory 


Single threaded
---------------
One command at a time

Synchronous - one at a time 

asynchronous - more than one at a time

Single threaded Synchronous execution - only one thing executing at a time

Synchronous  
------------------------------
1. get the data from database
2. get the file from network location 
3. update the file with data from database

asynchronous
-------------
1. get the data from database
1. get the file from network location 
2. update the file with data from database

Scope - Where a variable is available in your code

Dynamic typing
---------------
We don't have to tell the engine what type of data a variable holds 
it figures out while your code is running.

Static typing
--------------
we need to explicitly mention that data type to engine 

bool isAdmin = "hello" // an error ?


Primitive Types
----------------

A type of data that represents a single value 

1. number    - number data type
2. string    - sequence of charcters ( we can use both '' and "" )
3. boolean   - true or false
4. undefined - represents lack of existance ( we should never set a varaible to this)
5. null      - represents lack of existance ( we can set a variable to this)
6. symbol    - used in ES6


functions
----------
1. Named functions or regular functions
2. Anonymous functions ( function expression)
3. Immediately invoked functions

Objects
-------
object is a collection of name value pairs

JSON
--------
Javascript Object Notation - inspired by the object literal notation

properties have to be wrapped in quotes for JSON
anythig which is JSOn valid os valid in object literal

-> Common usage of JSON  is to exchange data to/from web servers
-> when sending data to a webserver that data has to be string 
   and we can use JSON.stringify()

JSOn.stringify - converts a javascript value to be serialized JSON string
JSON.parser    -  deserializes a JSON representation to a javascript object

Arrays
--------
An array is an object that can store a collection of items 

useful when you want to store large amount of data

Callback functions
------------------
Function being passed as a parameter to another 
function is called callback function

call, bind, apply
-----------------

bind - creates a copy of that function and sets 'this' keyword

call - sets 'this' keyword and executes the function immediately
       and it deosn't create a new copy of the function.

apply - apply method is similar to call. The difference is that
        apply methods accepts an array of arguments instead of 
        comma seperated values.

The call, bind, apply methods cn be used to set 'this' keyword 
independent of how function is called.

Class
------
Javascript is a prototype-based language which conatins no class statement 
such a C# or java

e.g. function Student() {}

instance: 
---------
var student1 = new Student();
var student2 = new Student();

contructor
-----------


prototype
----------
It is an object that is associated with every function and object by 
default in javascript.

This is a special type of object to which additional properties can 
be attached which can be sshared across all the instances of its 
constructor function.

Uses
-------
1. Access properties and method of an class object
2. To implement inheritance

== v ===
---------
== will only check for value
=== will check for value and type

inheritance
-----------
One Object getting access to the properties and methods of another object

in Javascript, inheritance is supported by using prototype object. 
This is also called prototypal inheritance.

Polymorphism
------------
Means function existing in "many forms". This describes the ability for 
objects to present the same interface for different behaviours

Error Handling
--------------
try -catch- finally

try {
    code that may thorw errors
}

catch {
    // code which needs to executed when there is an error
}

finally {
    // code to be executed regardless of an error
}

Singleton Design Pattern
------------------------
Limits  the number of instances of a perticular object to just one.
This single instance is called the singleton.

Singletons are useful in situations where system-wide actions need to be 
co-ordinated from a single single cental place.

Eg: Database connection Pool 

Module Pattern
----------------
Deals with code encapsulation. 
It is used to create private and public properties.
